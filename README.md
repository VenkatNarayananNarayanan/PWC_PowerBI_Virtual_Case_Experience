I Completed PWC'Power BI Virtual Case Experience' at Forage, where I learned how to create the PowerBI Dashboards by defining proper KPIs and 
calculating measures that are required for the analysis of the dataset. Also experimented with many visualisations which helps to solve an organizational problem and 
found the solutions for the growth of the company. During this program, I had the opportunity to create various fascinating dashboards for three tasks.

Task 1: Call Centre Trends 
Visualising customer and agent behaviour.

Task 2: Customer Retention
Customer demographics and insights.

Task 3: Diversity & Inclusion
Gender balance in the executive suite.

Note : Use Microsoft PowerBI to open the source file and If you don't have PowerBI I have attached the dashboard image for each task so you can refer images to under the outcome and methods.
